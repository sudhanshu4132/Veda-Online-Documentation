# Email Notifications

This document explains **how email notifications work in Veda Online**, what triggers an email, who receives it, and how users can control notifications easily.

## How Email Notifications Work (Quick Summary)

**An email is sent only when:**

1.  The notification is enabled in your **User Profile**, **and**
2.  The **Email checkbox for that specific action** (if available) is checked.

Both conditions must be satisfied.

## What Will I Get an Email For?

| Action you perform | Will you get an email? | Who receives the email |
|----|----|----|
| Sync a model | If Profile + Navigator checkbox are enabled | Only you |
| Run (Solve) model | If Profile + Run checkbox are enabled | You + study collaborators |
| Process Results | If enabled in User Profile | Only you |
| Process Reports | If enabled in User Profile | You + study collaborators |

Email triggers and recipients

## 1. User Profile – Global Email Settings

The **User Profile** acts as the master control for email notifications.

**Path:** `User Profile → Email Notifications tab (/UserProfile.aspx)`

### Available Options

- **Navigator Sync** – Emails for model synchronization
- **Runs Solve** – Emails when a model run (solve) completes
- **Results Created** – Emails when results are processed
- **Reports Created** – Emails when reports are processed

### Important Notes

- These settings apply to **all models**
- You must click **Save Settings** for changes to take effect
- Saved settings automatically populate Email checkboxes in Navigator and Run Manager

## 2. Navigator – Sync Email Checkbox

In the **Navigator** module, an **Email** checkbox is available next to the **Synchronize** button.

### Behavior

<figcaption>Navigator – Sync email checkbox</figcaption>
</figure>

- Default state comes from your **User Profile**
- If unchecked, **no email** is sent for that sync
- You can check the box to send email for **this one sync only**

### Override Clarification

- This checkbox **temporarily overrides** the saved profile setting
- It does **not permanently change** your User Profile preferences

### Recipient Rule

- Sync emails are sent **only to the user**
- **Model collaborators never receive Sync emails**

## 3. Run Manager – Solve Email Checkbox

In the **Run Manager**, an **Email** checkbox is available in Run Settings.

### Behavior

<figure class="align-center">

<figcaption>Run Manager – Email checkbox</figcaption>
</figure>

- Default state comes from your **User Profile**
- When checked, an email is sent after the run completes
- The email contains **Run Status and Report Status**

### Override Clarification

- You may enable or disable the checkbox for a **specific run only**
- This does **not modify** your saved User Profile settings

### Recipient Rule

Email is sent to:

- The user
- Study collaborators (only if the study is shared)

## 4. Results – Email Behavior

Emails for **Results** are triggered only when results are processed from **Operation Settings**.

### Key Rules

## Important Difference: Results vs Reports
